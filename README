README file for Pymacs
======================

Pymacs is a powerful tool which, once started from Emacs, allows
both-way communication between Emacs Lisp and Python.  Pymacs aims
Python as an extension language for Emacs rather than the other way
around, and this asymmetry is reflected in some design choices.  Within
Emacs Lisp code, one may load and use Python modules.  Python functions
may themselves use Emacs services, and handle Emacs Lisp objects kept in
Emacs Lisp space.

See http://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca for more documentation, including
the manual in HTML form.  The canonical Pymacs distribution is available
as http://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/archives/Pymacs.tar.gz.
You may also get all files, and their history as well, through the command::

    git clone git://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/pymacs

yet beware this is still an experiment, and I may reset branches.
