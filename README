README file for Pymacs
======================

  **Some news!**  I recently decided to resume Pymacs maintenance.
  I've been unable, for quite a while now, to reach the official
  maintainer, who replaced me.  As I'm using Emacs only sporadically,
  I'll have to much rely on current Pymacs users for pretesting!

  Nothing much new for the next release!  The manual now uses Docutils.
  There is the skeleton of a validation suite.  (It needed Emacs as a
  slave of Python, rather than the other way around, but this would
  need much improvment before being usable outside testing.)  I have
  no pending bug reports here (maybe I transmitted them all years ago?
  -- I do not remember), not much suggestions either.  But I got a few
  contributions to sort out, and also, nice, kind, warm letters from
  enthusiastic kind users :-).

Pymacs is a powerful tool which, once started from Emacs, allows
both-way communication between Emacs Lisp and Python.  Pymacs aims
Python as an extension language for Emacs rather than the other way
around, and this asymmetry is reflected in some design choices.  Within
Emacs Lisp code, one may load and use Python modules.  Python functions
may themselves use Emacs services, and handle Emacs Lisp objects kept in
Emacs Lisp space.

Here are some other Pymacs resources:

+ http://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca

  This README file (you are likely visiting it right now).

+ http://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/pymacs.html

  The Pymacs manual in HTML format.

+ http://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/pymacs.pdf

  The Pymacs manual in PDF format.

+ http://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/archives/Pymacs.tar.gz

  The latest snapshot of a Pymacs distribution.  Beware that, at
  least as of today, it might be an in-the-works, unstable version.

+ A :code:`git` repository for Pymacs sources and history

  ::

    git clone git://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/pymacs

  should produce your copy of the repository.  However, consider this
  to be fairly experimental for now.  The server might not even be up
  (then just tell me!).  This copy gets randomly synchronised with my
  real work repository, which is itself a sandbox, for which branches
  may be reset at any time.
