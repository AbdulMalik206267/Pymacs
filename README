Pymacs is a powerful tool which, once started from Emacs, allows both-way
communication between Emacs Lisp and Python.  Pymacs aims Python as an
extension language for Emacs rather than the other way around, and this
assymetry is reflected in some design choices.  Within Emacs Lisp code, one
may load and use Python modules.  Python functions may themselves use Emacs
services, and handle Emacs Lisp objects kept in Emacs Lisp space.

manual in HTML form.  The distribution holds the documentation sources, as
well as PostScript and PDF renderings.  The canonical Pymacs distribution is
