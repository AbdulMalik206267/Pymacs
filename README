README file for Pymacs
======================

  **Some news!**  *I decided to resume Pymacs maintenance, after having
  been unable, for quite a while now, to reach the maintainer who
  replaced me.  For the incoming release, the manual is in reST format,
  there is the start of a validation suite, most reported bugs have
  been squashed.  Some suggestions are still to be pondered, other
  contributions to be sorted out.  Oh! and I got many nice, kind, warm,
  comforting letters from enthusiastic users :-). Thanks to all of you!*

Pymacs is a powerful tool which, once started from Emacs, allows
both-way communication between Emacs Lisp and Python.  Pymacs aims
Python as an extension language for Emacs rather than the other way
around, and this asymmetry is reflected in some design choices.  Within
Emacs Lisp code, one may load and use Python modules.  Python functions
may themselves use Emacs services, and handle Emacs Lisp objects kept in
Emacs Lisp space.

The Pymacs manual offers the installation instructions, detailed
description of the API usage, examples, and also pointers to other
Pymacs sites or projects.  Both PDF and HTML formats may be found here:

  + http://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/pymacs.html

The latest *official* Pymacs distribution does not currently work with
Python 2.5.  This should be solved with the next release to replace it,
now due soon.  This official distribution may be fetched from:

  + http://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/archives/Pymacs.tar.gz

Other distributions, either older than the official one, or beta versions for
the next incoming release, are available in this directory:

I would be sorry that people bleed on my edges :-). Yet, if you feel in
play mood, there is a :code:`git` repository for Pymacs, a copy of which
is publicly reachable.  This is really my own sandbox for experiments,
and branches may be reset at any time.  The server might not even be up
(then just tell me!).  To get your own copy, try::

    git clone git://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/pymacs
