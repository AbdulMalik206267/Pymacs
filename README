README file for Pymacs
======================

  **Some news!**  I recently decided to resume Pymacs maintenance.
  I've been unable, for quite a while now, to reach the official
  maintainer, who replaced me.  As I'm using Emacs only sporadically,
  I'll have to much rely on current Pymacs users for pretesting!

  Nothing so much new in the incoming release!  The manual now uses
  Docutils.  There is the start of a validation suite.  Still pending
  here: a few bug reports to solve, some suggestions to ponder, other
  contributions to sort out.  But also, nice, kind, warm letters from
  enthusiastic users :-).

Pymacs is a powerful tool which, once started from Emacs, allows
both-way communication between Emacs Lisp and Python.  Pymacs aims
Python as an extension language for Emacs rather than the other way
around, and this asymmetry is reflected in some design choices.  Within
Emacs Lisp code, one may load and use Python modules.  Python functions
may themselves use Emacs services, and handle Emacs Lisp objects kept in
Emacs Lisp space.

The Pymacs manual offers the installation instructions, detailed
description of the API usage, examples, and also pointers to other
Pymacs sites or projects.  Both PDF and HTML formats may be found here:

  + http://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/pymacs.html

The latest *official* Pymacs distribution does not currently work with
Python 2.5.  This should be solved with the next release to replace it,
now due soon.  This official distribution may be fetched from:

  + http://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/archives/Pymacs.tar.gz

Other distributions, either older than the official one, or beta versions for
the next incoming release, are available in this directory:

I would not like seeing people bleed because they scratched themselves
on edges :-). Yet, if you feel in a play mood, there is a :code:`git`
repository for Pymacs, a copy of which is publicly reachable.  This is
really my own sandbox for experiments, for which branches may be reset
at any time.  The server might not even be up (then just tell me!).  To
get your own copy, try::

    git clone git://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/pymacs
